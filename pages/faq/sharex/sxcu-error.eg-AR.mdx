# I can't upload to sxcu.net

If you see an error popup after uploading an image, saying something along the lines of
`System.Exception: Invalid function name: "color"` then your upload settings are invalid.
This is caused by a recent Sharex update which added custom `{functions}`, mixing up with the json syntax.

Follow the steps below to fix this issue:

<Steps>

### Go to custom uploader settings

Open **Destinations**, then go to **Custom uploader settings**.
 Select **sxcu.net** from the **Uploaders** list.

### Fix variable

Copy the value of `og_properties` into notepad, and then place backslashes ( \\ ) before each curly bracket in the code (e.g. `\{"color":"#ff0000"\}`)

### Replace code

Copy all of the code back from notepad, and paste it into ShareX where it was before.
</Steps>
