# BetterDiscord installer isn't detecting my Discord installation

There are two main reasons for this, and they are as follows:

- **You have Discord installed in ProgramData, rather than the local AppData.**
- Change the path of your installer from what it is to `%programdata%/%username%/Discord/app-1.0.9005/resources`
- **You have an old version of Discord in your Discord installation folder, and the installer is picking it up. To fix this:**
- Click `Browse` and choose the folder named `app-1.0.9005`.
