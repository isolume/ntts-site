If you cannot find the `.spicetify` folder in your **Users** folder, it's most likely been moved to your `appdata/Roaming` folder.
**To get to the `appdata\Roaming` folder, follow the steps below:**
1. Open Run (`Win + R`).
2. Type in `%appdata%` and press **OK**.

Your `.spicetify` folder should be in the folder that was opened.
